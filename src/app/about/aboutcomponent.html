    What is Gondola?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Gondola is a meme from the mid to late 2010's. It's this small brown armless creature that was first seen on Finnish meme forums. Since its start, it grew to be a symbol online of “being unable to affect the world around you, so you just observe and take it all in”, because it's said it can't do anything without arms. 
    This symbolism led people to create posts of gondola in certain places sometimes with music or sound effects, admiring or dreading the world around it, letting people express their feelings about how they see a part of the world.

  <h2>
    Why Gondola?
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>These memes were popular  in the mid to late 2010's when I grew up. They've since started to go away and being able to search for them online is becoming more and more difficult. </li>
    <li>Gondola is one of my and many other people's favorite memes. People really enjoy seeing a gondola in a scene with fitting music and imagining the world around the character as if they were there instead of the gondola. Again, gondola was created as a manifestation of being unable to act, and only able to observe, so there is a kind of peace there, especially for people who feel overwhelmed by life. </li>
    <li>There are not many hubs for gondola posts anymore, and many of them make it difficult to search for specific gondolas. This website was meant to be a more browsable archive.</li>
    <li>Maybe this website could spur on the creation of even more gondola posts. </li>
